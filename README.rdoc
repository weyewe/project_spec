How to improve this functional spec builder into UAT?


1 Phase ==  2 context: 
(1) before the object is in that phase: verify all the pre-conditions that must be happening
(2) after the object is in that phase: verify the effect to its surrounding


What must it do?
1. From all the phases, generate UAT. 

From functional spec, generate UAT. How can we achieve this?
